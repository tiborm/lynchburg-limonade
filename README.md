## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

I added a few very basic tests just for demo purpuse.
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
